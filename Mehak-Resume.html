          WORK EXPERIENCE:<br>
          •	Student Internship at CERN		<br>			Geneva, Switzerland, June 2017
          Attended a 10-day internship on particle physics at European Council for Nuclear Research Geneva, Switzerland<br> during June 2017, organized by LifeLab and Birla Vidya Niketan. The internship included visiting various parts of the laboratory, attending lectures on Higgs Boson and the different particle accelerators present and learning more about the History of Web.
          •	Blu-bot<br>
          I, along with two other classmates, built a smartphone-controlled robot car termed ‘Blu-bot' <br>using an Arduino Uno as it’s microcontroller. The communication used here is serial over Bluetooth with an android smartphone. An app was subsequently designed and coded in android studio using java to be able to control the bot and alongside that, the Arduino was coded in C++ with the necessary instructions.
